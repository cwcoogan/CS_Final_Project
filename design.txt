My design process for the 15 Puzzle Sliding Game changed many different 
times throughout the development. I began by creating my game 
using various functions and quickly found it to be inefficient. From this
point on I refactored my code and stored everything into classes so that I could
call objects and use methods.

I imported a number of different Python modules/libraries such as Math, Pickle, 
Time, and Functools. These libraries were necessary for some of the key 
components such as storing the leaderboard data, allowing my Turtle to access
specific (x, y) coordinates, and additional functionality.

My design structure revolved around my data structures and what would be the most
efficient and fastest way to retrieve data that I could think of. Throughout my 
code, I used dictionaries to allow me to store shuffled and un-shuffled Images
to display. I also took advantage of nested lists for the tile swapping.

In the end is the result of a fully functional 15-sliding puzzle that users can play 
and have their name appear on the leader board if they successfuly won within the
player move criteria. 

P.S. - Load 'cookie.puz' in the game for a fun puzzle! Enjoy.
