The 15 puzzle sliding game was a lot of fun to create. I used a variation
of classes and functions to make it possible. There were many different 
Python libraries that I needed to import to make it work smoothly. For example
I imported Math, Pickle, time, functools and more.

I refactored my code probably 20+ times throughout this experience. I started out
creating my game using functions and quickly realized that it was not efficient.
Throughout the process, I began creating classes for the gameboard to allow me to 
use objects throughout to get a handful of needed components. The sliding puzzle 
requires many different Turtle objects to be created which was one of the driving 
factors to use classes. 

In order to get the sliding to work, I imported Partial which allows onclick() to take
x,y coordinates to make the sliding work faster. The data structures that I used
throughout were mainly lists and dictionaries. If any lists were used they were either
converted to a dictionary or nested.

In the end is the result of a fully functional 15-sliding puzzle that users can play
with and have their name appear on the leader board if they successfuly won within the
player move criteria.
